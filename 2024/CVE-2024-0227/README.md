### Description

Devise-Two-Factor does not throttle or otherwise restrict login attempts at the server by default. When combined with the Time-based One Time Password algorithm's (TOTP) inherent entropy limitations, it's possible for an attacker to bypass the 2FA mechanism through brute-force attacks.
